"""Optional image-embedding predictor tool — template, default-off.

The baseline does not consume the frozen image embeddings in
``features.json``. This module is a ready-to-wire *template* showing how a
participant can expose a predictor as an MCP tool **without** leaking raw
feature vectors into the LLM context: the tool loads the embeddings via
:class:`~chimera_agent_baseline.features.FeatureStore`, runs a model, and
returns only a compact score/label the agent can reason over.

Enable it with ``agent.predictor.enabled=true``. Then replace
:func:`run_predictor` with your trained head — it receives **all** of a
patient's embeddings (MRI / biopsy / prostatectomy, whichever are present), so
you can use a single origin or fuse them multimodally. E.g. a Cox head over the
fused features for task 3, or a classifier for tasks 1 / 2.
